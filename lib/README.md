# External libraries

`js-zoomable-images` depends on the following external libraries:

* https://leafletjs.com/
* https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.fullscreen
* https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF
* https://github.com/sfomuseum/leaflet-image-control
* https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-image
* https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js

Copies of each are included in the `lib` directory for development and debugging purposes.
